# UDACITY Project 'Explore-Bikeshare-Data Using R Language'
#### Udacity Project for Intro to Data science
###### This project created on 8/5/2020.
In this project, you will see the usage of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington).

### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

> Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

` The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: `
* Gender
* Birth Year

 ### What Software Do You Need?
 For working on your local machine, you will need to install R.
